# Snipra Status

## 2026-05-22
Codex rebuilt the project from the prompt into a Next.js App Router SaaS mock/product scaffold.

## Completed
- Created Next.js source structure with TypeScript, Tailwind and App Router.
- Added all requested routes: `/`, `/login`, `/onboarding`, `/dashboard`, `/assistant`, `/leads`, `/companies`, `/companies/[id]`, `/contacts`, `/contacts/[id]`, `/campaigns`, `/campaigns/[id]`, `/emails`, `/analytics`, `/inbox`, `/settings`, `/settings/mailboxes`, `/settings/team`, `/settings/billing`.
- Built Swedish-first landing page, app shell, command palette, mobile nav, dashboard, lead discovery, company intelligence, contact views, campaign views, email studio, analytics, inbox and settings views.
- Added realistic Swedish mockdata for companies, signals, contacts, campaigns, emails and analytics.
- Added localization foundation via `lib/i18n.tsx` and localized mockdata fields.
- Added Supabase schema with RLS draft and Edge Function stubs.
- Added `PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md`, `SNIPRA_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` and `.agents/product-marketing.md`.

## Verification
- `npm.cmd run type-check` passed.
- `npm.cmd run build` passed.
- Local devserver smoke-tested all primary routes with HTTP 200 while the server was running.

## Notes
- Persistent background devserver processes are terminated by the tool environment after command completion. Run `npm.cmd run dev -- --port 3000` locally to keep it open.
- `chorus` was not available in PATH, so cross-agent messages could not be sent.

## 2026-05-22 Shell Fix
- Root cause from npm log: npm was launched from `C:\Users\Anton L`, so it searched for `C:\Users\Anton L\package.json` instead of the project package.
- Added `C:\Users\Anton L\package.json` proxy scripts that forward `npm.cmd run dev`, `build`, `type-check` and `start` to `C:\Users\Anton L\snipe-leads`.
- Added project-local `snipra.cmd` launcher and `scripts/windows-shell.md`.
- Did not change PowerShell execution policy. Use `npm.cmd` instead of `npm` in PowerShell unless the user explicitly approves a broader user-level policy change.

## 2026-05-22 Visual Rebuild Recovery
- Restored Tailwind output by adding Tailwind layer directives to `app/globals.css`.
- Rebuilt the visual direction from `snipra.html`: Fraunces display typography, JetBrains Mono kickers, ruled editorial grids, ochre/mineral/paper tokens, ledger rows, marquee, dark proof section and publication-style product surfaces.
- Replaced the generic SaaS dashboard shell with editorial app navigation, PageShell layouts, ledgers, timelines and compact manuscript/workspace views.
- Rebuilt onboarding as a styled editorial wizard instead of browser-default inline controls.
- Added mobile containment/polish rules for 12-column editorial grids, app nav scrolling and narrow text columns.
- Verification passed: `npm.cmd run build`, sequential `npm.cmd run type-check`, generated CSS utility search, production HTTP 200 route smoke for `/`, `/onboarding`, `/dashboard`, `/leads`, `/companies/byggkompaniet-syd`, `/campaigns/lokal-expansion-syd`, `/emails`, `/analytics`, `/settings`.
- Final screenshots captured in `C:\tmp\snipra-final-*.png`.

## 2026-05-22 Chorus Fork Install
- Installed `agent-chorus@0.9.1` globally from `C:\Users\Anton L\agent-chorus-fork`.
- Removed generated `chorus.ps1` / `chorus-node.ps1` shims so PowerShell resolves `chorus` to the working npm `.cmd` shim without changing execution policy.
- Ran `chorus setup --context-pack`; provider wiring and context-pack templates were created, but Git hook install failed because `C:\Users\Anton L\snipe-leads` is not currently a Git repository.
- Ran plain `chorus setup --json`; project provider snippets and managed blocks are installed in `.agent-chorus/`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and `.gitignore`.
- Verified `chorus --version`, `chorus doctor --json`, `chorus send`, `chorus messages --clear`, and `chorus read --agent codex --cwd ... --json`.
- Remaining doctor warnings are environmental: no Gemini/Claude/Cursor sessions discovered for this project, registry update check blocked, Claude CLI not found, Git hooks not configured because this folder has no `.git`.

## 2026-05-22 Conclude
- Session log updated at `session-logs/2026-05-22-codex-snipra-rebuild.md`.
- Next focus: connect mockdata to Supabase, generate database types after schema application, implement real AI/mail adapters, add browser/UI regression coverage, and split `components/WorkspaceViews.tsx` before the next large feature pass.

## 2026-05-24 Design Draft Polish — Claude
- Landing page (`/` → `editorial-clean` variant) **APPROVED** by user.
- Fixed gradient (ochre tint): replaced blurred blob (clipped by `body { overflow-x: hidden }`) with pure CSS radial-gradient div on `<main>` at `top-0`. No filter = no clipping.
- Header frosted glass: `bg-paper/30 backdrop-blur-xl` (was `/60` — now 50% more see-through).
- Gradient: `circle at 18% 0%`, opacity 0.3, transparent 65%, h-860px, mask fades 78%→100%.
- Dashboard portal needs further work — open thread for next session.
- Session log: `session-logs/2026-05-24-session-log.md`
- Active plan: `plans/2026-05-24-snipra-design-drafts.md`
- **Next focus: dashboard portal improvements** (`/design-drafts/editorial-clean/portal`).

## 2026-05-24 Vercel CI/CD — Claude
- Vercel project `snipra` created under `olofluns-projects` and linked to `https://github.com/oloflun/snipe-leads`.
- GitHub Actions workflows added: `main` → production, `development` → preview.
- `vercel.json` with `"git": {"deploymentEnabled": false}` prevents duplicate deploys from Vercel's own Git integration.
- `package-lock.json` committed (required by `actions/setup-node@v4 cache: npm`).
- Both pipelines verified working end-to-end.
- Session log: `session-logs/2026-05-24-session-log-2.md`
- **Next focus: dashboard portal improvements** — ask user what specifically needs fixing.
